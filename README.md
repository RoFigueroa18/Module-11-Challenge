# Module-11-Challenge

This new assignment encompasses two technical deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News Articles
The goal of this deliverable is to extract titles and preview texts from Mars news articles available on the website https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
This deliverable involves web scraping and analyzing meteorological data collected by the Curiosity rover on Mars, available at https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. The analysis includes examining minimum temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and other environmental factors to gain insights into the climatic conditions during different Martian months.

To complete this assignment, I utilized various resources, including Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT, to debug and optimize the code. Specifically, ChatGPT was instrumental in exporting the scraped data to a JSON file and in the implementation of pd.Categorical, which ensured that the months in the bar charts were displayed in a specific order based on average minimum temperatures and average pressures, rather than being ordered numerically.
